   - Advanced signal parsing with multiple pattern support
   - Professional error handling and logging
   - Risk management with position sizing
   - Order management (entries, stop-loss, take-profits)
   - Safety features (simulation mode, validation, limits)

2. **`requirements.txt`** - All necessary dependencies

3. **`.env.example`** - Configuration template with detailed settings

4. **`README.md`** - Comprehensive documentation including:
   - Setup instructions
   - Safety guidelines
   - Troubleshooting guide
   - Best practices

5. **`trading-bot.service`** - Systemd service file for Linux deployment

6. **`monitor.py`** - Health monitoring script with alerting

### **üîê Key Safety Features:**

- **Simulation Mode**: Test without real money
- **Testnet Support**: Practice on Binance testnet
- **Risk Limits**: Position sizing, max exposure controls
- **Signal Validation**: Checks risk-reward ratios
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Track all activities
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Won't process same signal twice

### **‚ö° Getting Started:**

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Configure:**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your credentials
   ```

3. **Test first:**
   ```bash
   # Run in simulation mode
   python main.py
   ```

4. **Monitor (optional):**
   ```bash
   python monitor.py
   ```

### **‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Reminders:**

1. **ALWAYS test on testnet first** for at least a week
2. **Start with minimum position sizes** when going live
3. **Never risk more than 1-2%** of your account per trade
4. **Monitor logs regularly** for any issues
5. **Keep your API keys secure** and use IP whitelist

The bot is now ready for testing. Start with `USE_TESTNET=true` and `ENABLE_TRADING=false` in your `.env` file to ensure everything works correctly before risking real funds.
